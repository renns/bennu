== General Tasks ==

* refactor the longpolling code so that we can return richer errors.  I.e. errors can have an error code and parms so the UI can give more complete error messages

* Update IntroductionResponse handler in NotificationListener so that it handles race conditions
    - It should make sure that if both parties accept, connections will always be made
    - It should make sure that if both parties accept, only one pair of connections will be made
    - A possible solution is to use database locking, preferably on the one introduction row

* hiding InternalId's from other connections (for any kind of query)

* rewriting the author on a query from a connection to be the connection instead of the alias

* what happens when we delete certain things like an alias? (e.g. are remote connections removed? content?)


== Things we don't handle and won't for demo but should for production ==

* changing an ACL or the label tree structures updates any existing standing queries
